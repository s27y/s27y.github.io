    <h1>About</h1>
    

    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I'm a 25-year-old software engineer on <a href="https://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>'s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/social/us/en/">SmartCloud</a> Operations team in Dublin</p>
<p>I have a Master of Science in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.ucd.ie/about-ucd/">University College Dublin</a></p>
<p>Previously I studied Networks and Distributed System in <a href="https://www.tcd.ie">Trinity College Dublin</a> and did my undergraduate course in <a href="https://www.dkit.ie">Dundalk Institute Of Technology</a>.</p>
<p>I am interested in coding, reading, <del>weight lifting(stoped trainning after 5 years)</del> and recently I pick up investing as I got a little bit extra cash.</p>
<p>Check my LinkedIn page from more details.

<h3>Why I create this blog?</h3>
<p>I always want to start writing to record the happiness and sadness in my life, but all I did was build a VPS/blog/WordPress and now pelican and then - totally forget about it after the website is up. This time, instead of building the website first, I am going to start writing first, then gradually improve the website.</p>
<p>After wasting all my nights in the last past seven months in endless web browsing, I am going to do something that memorable. </p>
<p>Writing is also a good way to improve my English. As a Chinese moved to Ireland since 2008, I spent my first 5 years in the Chinese circle, no wonder my English has not improved.</p>
