    <p>I bought tons of domain in the last few years - qero.net, ebe.me, yang.so and the one I finally started using since yesterday afternoon - YangSun.me</p>
<p>This domain was registered on an impulse in late 2014, but due to the work load from the study of my master course in UCD, it took me more than a year to get my hand on this domain.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, I was reading a Java Cert book and started feeling boring with the tricky exam questions, so I did a quick lookup on my favourite domain reseller - <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=96185">NameCheap</a>. Yes! My expired domain can be registered now. I registered the domain and added three DNS settings, less than 12 hours, YangSun.me is up and running.</p>
<p>The first time I notice <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=96185">NameCheap</a> is from GitHub. GitHub has a special perk for students called <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Developer Pack</a>. The pack has many free bits for students(like free one year .me domain name from <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=96185">NameCheap</a>, free 50$ credit in <a href="https://m.do.co/c/f68d634be5d8">DigitalOcean</a>, and many more!)</p>
<p>This domain was first registered in December 2014 when I was attending my Master course in <a href="http://www.ucd.ie">UCD</a>. The main reason at that time was I want to create a website with my CV and my project on it. After I registered the domain for free with <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=96185">NameCheap</a>, I created a HTML page and link it to <a href="http://github.com/s27y">my GitHub</a>. Then I totally forgot about the website.</p>
<p>What am I going do with this domain?</p>
<p>I always want to start writing to record the happiness and sadness in my life, but all I did was build a VPS/blog/WordPress and now pelican and then - totally forget about it after the website is up. This time, instead of building the website first, I am going to start writing first, then gradually improve the website.</p>
<p>What about other domain names?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ebe.me</p>
<p>Leave it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yang.so</p>
<p>I will keep it as a side project</p>
</li>
</ul>
